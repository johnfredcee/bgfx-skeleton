A starter skeleton for projects using  Bgfx 
===========================================

This is a simple helloworld project that uses [Bfgx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx)

Usage is simple - buid bgfx and point cmake at it. 
This has been tested only with Visual Studio 2015 on Windows.

Much of the CMake magic has been taken from [Termite](https://github.com/septag/termite)
